        <h2>Removed Mods:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Bits and Chisles - It kept crashing the server so... (sorry dylan)
            </li>

        <h2>Known Bugs:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If you begin to levitate due to Juno's "Nuke" ability, and the nuke is cancelled, if you are too far away from Juno, you will not loose the levitation effect. So if you are ever picked up by the ability, make sure to stay close to Juno!
